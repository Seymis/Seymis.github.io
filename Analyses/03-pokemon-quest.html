								<p>Pokémon Quest is an action-adventure spinoff game developed by Game Freak under the publication of Nintendo that utilises the cartoon art style, chiptune sound and music, and the interactivity of the gameplay loop to create a memorable gameplay experience. The game was released on mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch during the launch of the seventh generation of the main franchise. Although the game is reminiscent of the innocent and youth oriented focus aspect of the rest of the series, the elements in Pokémon Quest also create a sense of nostalgia for the older generation of fans</p>
								<p><b>Art and Style</b><br />
								Pokémon Quest uses its blocky, voxel art-style as the game’s main gimmick, separating itself from the main Pokémon series. The traditional, older generation of Pokémon games revolves around 2D sprites, with the most recent adaptations focusing on the anime stylised 3D models. As a result, Pokémon Quest creates an implication that the world is an alternate dimension from the main franchise.Furthermore, the creatures live on the game controller-shaped Tumblecube Island, known as Pokexels, a truncated compound of the words Pokémon and voxel</p>
								<p>The game’s aesthetic is not only a breath of fresh air, but also alludes to the initial video games. Due to the voxel style of the game, Pokémon Quest looks like a modernised adaptation of a pixelated game as all assets are made with cubes and squares. The 2D sprites such as the patches of grass are also similar to the ﬁrst generation of the main franchise on Game Boy and thus, creates a sense of nostalgia for the long-time players.</p>
								<p>However, the visual style of the game not only attracts the attention of the older generation, but appeals to the younger generation as well. This is emphasised by the cubic style which is reminiscent of building blocks or Lego as well as the bold, vibrant colour palette of the game– light green for the bug Pincushion Plain and yellow for the ﬂying-type Parched Peak region, making it easy for children to differentiate between the regions.The idea that the artistic style of the game is directed towards children is further underscored by the Cube-Shaped Pokémon on Cubie Island?! animated shorts on Pokémon Kids TV in 2023. The swift, cartoon-like animation from the Pokémon in the game when they attack or twirl holds a fun and youthful connotation which also appeals to the younger generation.</p>
								<p>The general producer of the game, Junichi Masuda, has worked on many Pokémon soundtracks since Pokémon Red, Green and Blue. He directed the games in a way they ‘always [has] the beginners in mind… We want to include everyone, no matter their age, no matter their gender.’ (Hoggins 2009). As such, Pokémon Quest caters towards both the young and the older generation of Pokémon fans, and the game’s artstyle ampliﬁes that idea to a great extent.</p>

								<p><b>Sound and Music</b><br />
								Pokémon Quest creates a feeling of familiarity by sharing the same leitmotif as the original Game Boy games and revolving the main soundtrack and sound effects around a chiptune sound. The energetic main soundtrack of the game creates an impression of a new journey, and the familiar chiptune soundtrack makes the player feel comfortable while playing the game. The 8-bit-like background music emphasises that nostalgic feeling due to the fact that the chiptune music shares the connotation of vintage video game consoles such as the Game Boy. The 8-bit feeling is underscored by the soundtracks either revolving around a synthesiser or brass instruments to express the feeling of a new adventure and the feeling of excitement.</p>
								<p>As well as the soundtrack, the sound effects also offer a sense of nostalgia and complexity to the game. For example, the sound effect for befriending a Pokémon in Pokémon Quest holds the same leitmotif as when a Pokémon is caught in the original games of the main franchise. The recognisable Pokémon screams are also present in all of the Pokémon games. This has a greater impact on the older generation of Pokémon fans who have been playing for a while, and can immediately recall the familiar sound effects. As well as familiarity, Kawahara, Noto and Kumagai also note in their analysis that “sound symbolism may affect the attractiveness of the products as well as the perception of their priciness.” As such, the game can be interpreted as a gift to the older fans due to the recycled sound effects.</p>

								<p><b>Core Gameplay Loop</b><br/>
								Pokémon Quest takes the core gameplay loop from the main franchise and adds its own spin to it, while still remaining true to its origins. In an interview, Junichi Masuda (Hoggins 2009) mentions that: <br />"Simply, I think Pokémon is very approachable. There are lots of attractive characters and people love the core gameplay of catching and training Pokémon."<br />
								The idea of catching and training Pokémon is instead revamped into the idea of attracting Pokémon at a base camp. The player can cook different recipes using ingredients to attract the Pokexels to expand their Pokedex. The game also introduces a variety of rewards as decorations which can be bought at the Poké Mart as well as upgrades to the cooking pot.</p>
								<p>The befriended Pokémon are then sent on a team of three on an expedition with the goal of exploring the island and clearing stages. Pelusi (2019) highlights the fact that the team setup and gameplay is similar to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, with a small team of Pokémon tackling hoards of enemies and collecting items until the defeat of the boss</p>
								<p>By completing the area, the player is rewarded with loot and experience points used to strengthen the party. Unlike the core series games, Pokémon in Pokémon Quest are only given two stats: HP and Attack. These stats can be boosted by Power Stones collected during the expedition and placed on a Pokémon’s Power Charm, making it easier to complete future levels. The experience points also serve to help with expeditions, levelling up the Pokémon and eventually evolving once a certain level has been reached thus, motivating the player to continue their expeditions and explore the entirety of the island.</p>
								
								<p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
								The combination of Pokémon Quest’s aesthetic, sound quality and the core gameplay loop allows the game to hold the player’s interest and encourages the idea of an alternate universe, with the overall carefree environment appealing to both the older and newer generation of Pokémon fans.</p>
