							<h1>The Beginnings of Sound Design</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Ever since the introduction of film and audio, sound designers have experimented with different technology to fundamentally change the aesthetics of the cinema and film-going experience. Game designers have implemented their knowledge and experience from film to create iconic music and sound effects in retro video games such as Atari 2600’s Pac-Man and Space Invaders.  </p>
							<p>These iconic games were first introduced in the form of penny arcades. However, the earliest electronic video games were developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: <i>Spacewar!</i> (1962) that had no sound. Then came the first mass-produced video game by Nutting Associates <i>Computer Space</i> in 1971. This was both a single player game where the user controlled a rocket ship and faced flying saucers as well as a two-player game where the players went up against each other. As a sci-fi rocket ship game, this was accompanied by space war-like sounds: rockets, thrusters and explosions. Regardless of the many video games that came before it, the pioneer and the first hit game in the industry would be <i>Pong</i> (1972) developed by Allan Alcorn. </p>
							<p>“The truth is, I was running out of parts on the board... I said, “Screw it, I don't know how to make any one of those sounds. I don’t have enough parts anyhow.” - Allan Alcorn (as cited in Kent, 2001) </p>
							<p>An interesting observation to regard is that instead of utilising sound design principles, the designer behind Pong had instead created the game’s iconic sound effects as a result of a lack of experience and technology in the 1970s. Even so, the sound effects, including <i>Pong</i>, were the main selling point of video games as a whole.  </p>
