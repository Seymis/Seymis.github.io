							<h1>The Future of Sound Design</h1>

							<p>Nowadays, the video games industry has become as popular as the film, music and book industries. As such, games company giants have emerged: Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Riot Games with the latter offering $5,000,000 USD at its major tournament <i>League of Legends World Championship 2025</i>. On the grounds that the company has enough budget to support extravagant eSports entrance ceremonies, they also have the money to support the technological advancements of their departments including the audio industry. There are teams dedicated towards audio with their own specific set of skills as opposed to the past where one person was responsible for the entire sound design. Nowadays, one can be in charge of the sound direction, dialogue, sound effects music, composition all to create a cooperative environment with the game designers and programmers.</p>
							<p>Ambience is recorded and dubbed in in contrast to the film industry where ambience is recorded on scene. Foley artists are hired for both realistic sounds as well as fantasy, larger than life sounds. The sounds can be recorded in studios or in field, then mixed and create a “more than real” (Collins 2008:21) sound in the studio. </p>
