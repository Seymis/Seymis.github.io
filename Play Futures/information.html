							<h1>Sound Design Principle: Information</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pacman.gif" alt="" /><center><i>Pac-Man (Science Museum Blog)</i></center></span>
							<p>One of the main responsibilities of sound design in the video games world is information. </p>
							<p>Sinclair (2020) notes that information can be summarised is a very simple equation: “Data + Context = Information”. </p>
							<p>For example, a basic arcade game with limited lives can communicate to the player that they are close to a game over by switching to a rapid up-tempo backtracking similar to that of a heartbeat. As a result, the music provides the user with helpful feedback as to what is happening in the game in terms of the life mechanic. Aside from lives or a threatening game over, there are many other ways sound can be used to convey information. </p>
							<p><b><u>Geometry/Environment </u></b>
								<ol>
									<li>Is the environment indoors or outdoors? </li>
									<li>What is the size of the room? </li>
									<li>What structures are there? </li>
									<li>Can we see the source of the sound? Partially see it? </li></p>
							</ol>

							<p><b><u>Distance: energy from reverb signals decay slower than dry signals. Therefore: </u></b>
								<ol>
									<li>Reverb </li>
										<ol>
											<li>The further away, the more reverb </li>
											<li>The closer, the dryer </li>
										</ol>
									<li>Air absorption: temperature, humidity and distance 
										<ol>
											<li>The higher it is, the more it sounds like a low pass filter makes it sound like it’s through a wall; further away </li>
										</ol>
									</li>
							</ol>

							<p><b><u>Location</u></b>
								<ol>
									<li>Interaural time difference (ITD): the time difference between one ear to the other  </li>
									<li>Interaural intensity difference (IID) or interaural level difference (ILD): difference in amplitude in the left and right ear </li>
									<li>The precedence effect: Direction of the source of sound in a closed space </li></p>
							</ol>

							<p><b><u>User Feedback and Game Mechanics </u></b>
								<ol>
									<li>The “Chime Vs Buzzer Principle”:  A chime notes whether a task or quest has been completed or not. A universal sound—associated with a positive sentiment A buzzer is noisy and is often a negatively viewed, maybe a task that has failed. </li>
									<li>    Audio mixing: the balance between music, dialogue and sound effects can attract the attention of the user and allows it to focus on a specific aspect of the game. </li>
							</ol>
